# 3x3 Cube Scramble Visualizer



# Description

A simple visualizer and scrambler for a 3x3 cube using Python's PyGame and OpenGL libraries. The programs generates a set of random moves and applies it to the cube with each move animated accordingly. 
The program then reverses the scrambling moves and then applies this new set of moves to the unsolved cube to bring it back to the solved state.

### Installing and Executing 

* Save the 2 .py files under the same directory
* Run the "3D Cube.py" file (Make sure you have installed the [required libraries](#description))

* Wait for the program to scramble the cube and then press the spacebar to bring it back to the solved state


### Troubleshooting
In case the moves are extremely fast or extremely slow, change the value of MoveSpeed variable in the first file
